**`The Simon Game`**

Game Instruction:
The Game start with by flashing a colour (e.g blue). The player must click on the blue button that flashed.
Next, the game shows the next colour (e.g red). The player has to remember the sequence (i.e blue and then red) and it goes on.
If the player misses the sequence of the button, Game Over!
